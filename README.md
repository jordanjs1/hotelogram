# Hotelogram: Hotel Automation System
Hotelogram is a simple Windows application developed as Object Oriented Programming Course Project in my university. Hotelogram is developed using C# and .NET Framework 4.6.1 on Visual Studio 2019. The program is developed to demonstrate simple object oriented programming concepts.

In its current form it supports: <br/>
* Adding, editing and removing guests, rooms and employees <br/>
* Bills that contain actions of guests <br/>
* Simple user and permission system (currently, users and permissions can be updated by editing the code)

The program is licensed under **The GNU GPLv3** License.
